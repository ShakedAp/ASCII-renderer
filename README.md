# 3D ASCII Renderer in the Terminal
This project is a 3D ASCII renderer that runs in the terminal, utilizing the ncurses library for graphical output. It allows users to create and view 3D models represented in ASCII art, giving them a simple, unique and retro visual experience.

## Features

* ASCII Rendering: The renderer takes 3D mesh, and displays it in the terminal using ASCII characters.
* Lighting and Shading: The renderer supports basic lighting and shading techniques, in order to view the 3D object clearly.
* User intereaction: The user can control the camera...
* Model loading: The project allows the user to load their own object and view it in the terminal.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ShakedAp/ASCII-renderer.git`.
1. Make sure the prerequisites are installed. The project relies on `pthread` and `ncurses`.
1. Compile the project using the Makefile: `make all`. Change the compiler to your compiler of choice.
1. Change the terminal font to be **monospace** font, and scale it down as much as possible, while being in full-screen.
1. Run the renderer `./bin <mesh-path>` (mesh is optional).
